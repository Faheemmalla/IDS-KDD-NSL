# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – Anomaly Detection

This project implements a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to classify network traffic as **Normal** or **Anomalous (Attack)** using the NSL-KDD dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier to detect malicious network activity based on network traffic features.

Workflow:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Model saved as `.pkl` file

## 📊 Dataset

Dataset used: **NSL-KDD**

Files:
- `KDDTrain+.txt` – Training dataset
- `KDDTest+.txt` – Testing dataset
- `kddcup.names` – Feature names
